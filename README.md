# Anthony Lee Stark's Sample Code Archive

Welcome to my **Code Repository**!  
This repository is where I archive various sample source code files and drafts that I have written over time.  
The purpose of this repository is to provide a space for me to store and organize my code snippets, as well as to share them with others who may find them useful.  
Feel free to use and modify the code as needed.

## Structure

The repository is structured into folders.  
Each folder dedicated to a specific programming language.  
Files are organized by the corresponding language they used.  
Below is an overview of the folder structure:

```
/
├── cpp/
│ ├── example1.cpp
│ ├── example2.cpp
│ └── ...
├── js/
│ ├── example1.js
│ ├── example2.js
│ └── ...
├── py/
│ ├── example1.py
│ ├── example2.py
│ └── ...
├── sql/
│ ├── query1.sql
│ ├── query2.sql
│ └── ...
├── Drafts.txt
├── README.md
└── ...
```

### Language Folders

- **`cpp/`**: Contains C++ source code files. These files demonstrate C++ syntax, algorithms, and various examples.
- **`js/`**: Contains JavaScript files for web development, Node.js scripts, or general-purpose examples.
- **`py/`**: Includes Python scripts, from basic examples to more complex problem-solving solutions.
- **...**

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:

   If you haven't cloned this repository yet, use the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sample-code-archive.git
   cd sample-code-archive
   ```

2. **Explore the folders**:

   Navigate to the specific folder for the language you're interested in. For example, if you want to explore the Python files, go to the `py/` folder: 
    
   ```bash
   cd py
   ``` 

3. **Run the code**:

   Each folder contains individual source code files that can be executed using the appropriate interpreter or compiler for that language.  
   - For **C++** files, you can compile and run with a C++ compiler, e.g., `g++ example1.cpp -o example1 && ./example1`.  
   - For **JavaScript** files, you can run them using Node.js, e.g., `node example1.js`.  
   - For **Python** files, execute them using the Python interpreter, e.g., `python3 example1.py`.
